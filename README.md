# CheckSync

A clean, minimalist web and mobile app for verified attendance check-ins through shared time-slot scheduling.

## Features

- **Weekly Calendar View**: See your entire week at a glance with visual status indicators
- **Time Slot Management**: Add, edit, and delete time slots with ease
- **Role-Based Check-In**: Participants check in, verifiers confirm attendance
- **Visual Status System**:
  - Grey = Planned
  - Yellow = Checked-in
  - Green = Confirmed
  - Red = Missed
- **Export Functionality**: Download attendance data as CSV
- **User Management**: Multiple users with participant/verifier roles
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on web and mobile devices

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth (Email + Google Sign-In)
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore (configured but using local state for demo)
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Date Handling**: date-fns

## Workspace-Based Multi-Tenancy

CheckSync uses **workspaces** (teams/projects) for complete isolation:

### **How It Works:**
1. **Create Workspace** - Anyone can create their own workspace
2. **Become Admin** - Creator is automatically admin of their workspace
3. **Invite Team** - Add members by email to your workspace
4. **Assign Roles** - Workspace admin assigns roles to members
5. **Isolated Data** - Each workspace has its own slots and members

### **Example:**
- **Tennis Club A** creates workspace â†’ Their admin manages tennis coaches
- **Tennis Club B** creates workspace â†’ Their admin manages their coaches
- **No data mixing** - Completely separate

### **Role Hierarchy (Per Workspace):**
- **ðŸ‘‘ Admin** - Workspace owner, full control
- **ðŸ“Š Manager** - Create/manage slots, verify, export
- **ðŸ”’ Verifier** - Verify attendance, check in
- **ðŸ‘¤ Participant** - Check in only

**Security:** Only workspace admins can assign roles within their workspace.
