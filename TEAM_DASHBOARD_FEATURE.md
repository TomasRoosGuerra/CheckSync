## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified/Created
```
src/components/TeamDashboard.tsx       ← NEW COMPONENT
src/store.ts                           ← Add "team-dashboard" view mode
src/components/Dashboard.tsx           ← Integrate Team Dashboard
```

### State Management
- Uses existing `allUserTimeSlots` from global store
- Filters based on `workspaceMembers` and user roles
- No additional Firestore subscriptions needed (efficient!)

### Permission Logic
```typescript
// Check if user is manager/admin in any workspace
const isManagerOrAdmin = workspaces.some((ws) => {
  const role = getUserWorkspaceRole(user?.id || "", ws.id, workspaceMembers);
  return role === "manager" || role === "admin";
});

// Filter to managed workspaces only
const managedWorkspaces = workspaces.filter((ws) => {
  const role = getUserWorkspaceRole(user?.id || "", ws.id, workspaceMembers);
  return role === "manager" || role === "admin" || isWorkspaceOwner(user, ws);
});
```

### Data Flow
```
User Opens App
    ↓
App.tsx subscribes to ALL slots across workspaces
    ↓
allUserTimeSlots populated in global store
    ↓
TeamDashboard filters by:
  - Managed workspaces (permission check)
  - Date range (today/week/all)
  - Selected workspace (optional)
    ↓
Display grouped by workspace → date
```
