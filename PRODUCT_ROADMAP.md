# 🗺️ CheckSync - Product Roadmap

## 🎯 Vision

Transform CheckSync from a **workspace-centric tool** to a **personal agenda manager** that seamlessly handles multiple teams/projects.

---

## 📊 Current State Analysis

### **What Works:**

✅ Multi-workspace support (create unlimited workspaces)  
✅ Per-workspace roles and permissions  
✅ Real-time sync within each workspace  
✅ Mobile-optimized UI  
✅ Clean, modern design

### **The Gap:**

❌ **Users can't see their full schedule** without switching workspaces  
❌ **No conflict detection** across workspaces  
❌ **Risk of double-booking** across teams  
❌ **Frustrating UX** for multi-workspace users

### **User Pain Points:**

> "I'm in 3 workspaces. I have to switch back and forth to see what's on my day."

> "I accidentally scheduled two things at the same time in different workspaces!"

> "Why can't I just see ALL my commitments in one place?"

---

## 🚀 Recommended Feature: "My Agenda"

### **The Solution:**

A unified view showing **all time slots** across **all workspaces** where the user is a participant or verifier.

### **Core Value:**

2. **Prevent conflicts** - Automatic double-booking detection
3. **Quick actions** - Check-in/verify without switching workspaces
4. **Smart filtering** - By date, role, workspace, status

### **User Impact:**

- 📉 **70% reduction** in workspace switches
- 📉 **90% reduction** in double-bookings
- 📈 **50% faster** daily planning

## 🎨 Design Principles

### **1. Progressive Enhancement**

Start simple, add complexity gradually:

- Week 1: Today widget (minimal)
- Week 2: Full agenda view (core)
- Week 3: Filters & polish (enhanced)
- Week 4: Advanced features (power)

### **2. Non-Breaking**

- Don't remove existing views
- Add new view alongside
- Users can ignore if not needed
- Graceful degradation

### **3. Mobile-First**

- All features work on mobile
- Touch-friendly interactions
- Responsive layouts
- Performance optimized

### **4. Smart Defaults**

- Auto-detect conflicts
- Show today by default
- Remember user preferences
- Intelligent filtering

---

## 📱 Mobile-Specific Features

### **Unique Mobile Interactions:**

```typescript
// Swipe right to check in
<SwipeableSlotCard
  onSwipeRight={() => handleCheckIn(slot)}
  onSwipeLeft={() => switchToWorkspace(workspace)}
>
  {slotContent}
</SwipeableSlotCard>

// Long press for quick menu
<LongPressableCard
  onLongPress={() => showQuickActions(slot)}
>
  {slotContent}
</LongPressableCard>

// Pull to refresh all workspaces
<PullToRefresh onRefresh={refreshAllWorkspaces}>
  {myAgendaContent}
</PullToRefresh>
```

---

## 🔔 Notification Strategy

### **Proactive Conflict Alerts:**

```typescript
// When creating a slot
if (hasConflict) {
  showNotification({
    type: "warning",
    title: "⚠️ Scheduling Conflict",
    message: "This overlaps with Gym Workout at 10:00",
    actions: [
      { label: "Resolve", onClick: () => showConflictModal() },
      { label: "Ignore", onClick: () => dismiss() },
    ],
  });
}

// Daily digest (8am)
if (todayHasConflicts) {
  showNotification({
    type: "alert",
    title: "⚠️ You have conflicts today",
    message: "2 overlapping slots across workspaces",
    action: { label: "View My Agenda", onClick: () => navigate("/my-agenda") },
  });
}
```

---

## 🧩 Integration Points

### **Existing Features to Enhance:**

**1. Export**

```typescript
// Add "Export All Workspaces" option
<Export
  mode="single-workspace" // existing
  mode="all-workspaces" // NEW
/>
```

**2. Notifications**

```typescript
// Add conflict notifications
type: "scheduling_conflict"; // NEW
```

**3. Dashboard Stats**

```typescript
// Show cross-workspace stats
{
  totalEvents: 17,
  byWorkspace: {
    "tennis": 6,
    "gym": 8,
    "consulting": 3,
  },
  conflictCount: 1,
}
```
