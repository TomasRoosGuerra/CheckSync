# CheckSync - Complete UX Guide

## 🎯 Architecture Overview

CheckSync is a **multi-tenant workspace system** where each user can create and manage their own independent workspaces (teams/projects).

### Key Concepts
- **Workspace** = Independent team/project (e.g., "Smith Tennis Club")
- **Workspace Owner** = Creator, automatic Admin role
- **Members** = Users invited to a workspace with assigned roles
- **Time Slots** = Scheduling events that belong to a workspace
- **Complete Isolation** = No data mixing between workspaces

---

## 🔐 Security & Data Isolation

### Firestore Structure:
```
workspaces/
  └─ {workspaceId}/
      ├─ name: "Smith Tennis Club"
      ├─ ownerId: "user123"
      └─ description: "..."

workspaceMembers/
  └─ {memberId}/
      ├─ workspaceId: "workspace123"
      ├─ userId: "user456"
      ├─ role: "participant"
      └─ joinedAt: timestamp

timeSlots/
  └─ {slotId}/
      ├─ workspaceId: "workspace123" ← KEY FILTER
      ├─ title: "Tennis Practice"
      ├─ participantIds: ["user456"]
      └─ ...

users/
  └─ {userId}/
      ├─ email: "user@example.com"
      ├─ name: "John Smith"
      └─ ...
```

### Query Filters:
```typescript
// Load ONLY slots for current workspace
query(
  collection(db, "timeSlots"),
  where("workspaceId", "==", currentWorkspace.id)
)

// Load ONLY members of current workspace
query(
  collection(db, "workspaceMembers"),
  where("workspaceId", "==", currentWorkspace.id)
)
```

### Security Rules (Firestore):
```javascript
// Only authenticated users
allow read, write: if request.auth != null;

// Future: Add workspace-level permissions
allow read: if request.auth.uid in 
  getWorkspaceMembers(resource.data.workspaceId);
```
